# Example deep learning algorithms running on Anylearn

2 extreme simple CNNs implemented with PyTorch and TensorFlow2 are presented here in `cnn-torch/` and `cnn-tensorflow2/` directories.

For running them on Anylearn, please refer to `anylearn-run-cnn-pytorch.py` and `anylearn-run-cnn-tensorflow2.py` respectively. Note that users are assumed to first sign up on [Anylearn](https://anylearn.nelbds.cn/) before using these examples. Fields `<username>` and `<password>` should thus be replaced with real user credentials in these scripts.
